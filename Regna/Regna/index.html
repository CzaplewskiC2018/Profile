            <p>
   About me: Hello all, I am Charles Czaplewski. I go to SJNMA.
 Outside of school, I live in Sun Prairie WI, if you were to ever visit there you'd be fooled into thinking it's a nice place.
 However if you were to look closer or go to the High School there you would see that it is cancerous for lack of better terms. 
I have many military ambitions inside and outside of SJNMA.           
            </p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">Green Berets</a></h4>
              <p class="description">For a career when im older I would like to be a Green Beret. People say the the Army Rangers are better,
                         or the Navy Seals. However this is all matter of opinion. All different types of special forces have different jobs.
                         This is why our military is so versatile. So in my opinion the Green Berets are the best. </p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">West Point</a></h4>
              <p class="description">For the end of my high school career I would like to get into West Point. I would like to leave west point
                         as a infantry officer. I would also like to get a masters degree in military history as that is something im very good at. </p>

                         gain tons of that farm boy muscle. </p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">Daisy the boxer</a></h4>
              <p class="description">I feel like a important talking point for me is my dog daisy. Daisy was a 10 year oil boxer at the time of her death.
                         She was the best dog i've ever known. She was very smart and caring which is a typical of boxers. The bottom line is
                         I lost my best friend and I didnt get to be there to see her go. 
                         (RIP Daisy Czaplewski - 2007-2017-)

          <h3 class="section-title">SGT (E-5)</h3>
          <p class="section-description">Taking Information directly from the Army:
“Sergeants (SGT) operate in an environment where the sparks fly - where the axe meets the stone. Although not the lowest level of rank where command
 is exercised, this level is the first at which enlisted soldiers are referred to as sergeant, and of all the grades of the NCO, this one, very possibly,
 has the greatest impact on the lower ranking soldiers. Privates, who are the basic manpower strength and grade of the Army, generally have sergeants as their
 first NCO leader. It is the grade sergeant that the privates will look to for example.

Like the next grade, the staff sergeant, the sergeant is responsible for the individual training, personal appearance and the cleanliness of their soldiers.
The sergeant is also responsible for insuring that
Each member of their unit is trained to competency in their MOS as prescribed in the appropriate soldiers manual.
    All government property issued to members of their unit is properly maintained and accounted for at all times and discrepancies are promptly reported.
    While on duty status, they be ready at all times to report to the location and activity of all members of their unit.
    Their unit is trained to function in its primary mission role.

The authority of the sergeant is equal to that of any other grade or rank of the NCO.Professionally competent leaders inherently command respect for their authority and the sergeant must be unquestionably competent in order to carry out the mission correctly, accomplish each task and care for assigned soldiers.
The rank of sergeant is not a position for learning how to become a leader, no apprenticeship here. While certainly the new sergeant will be developing new skills, strengthening old ones and generally getting better, he is a sergeant!!! and is therefore, no less a professional than those grades of rank to follow.”
